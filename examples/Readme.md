Examples
========

Some example programs for various hats. Check the lib-directory for
necessary (CircuitPython) drivers.


Scroll pHat HD
--------------

Pimoroni's Scroll pHAT HD (now a retired product). Should also work
with the Scroll Hat Mini (<https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-hat-mini>).

A hat with 11x7 (monochrome) LEDs. The example is from
<http://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_IS31FL3731> and
uses the driver from that repo.


Touch pHat
----------

Pimoroni's Touch pHat <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/touch-phat>.

The driver for the pHat and the CAP1166 chip were ported from the
Linux-version supplied by Pimoroni.


4-Letter pHat
-------------

A 4x14 segment display pHat <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/four-letter-phat>.

Works out of the box with <http://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HT16K33>.


LED-Shim
--------

Also from Pimoroni <https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/led-shim>.

Same driver as the scroll pHat: <http://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_IS31FL3731>. The example is from that repo too.
